# Puppet tools for ssh

The module defines several resources for SSH. Notably:

 * ssh::resource::sshd -- Ensure sshd runs (or does not) on the specified node.
 * ssh::resource::key  -- Create or destroy an ssh key for a given user.
 * ssh::resource::known_hosts -- Create or destroy a user's known_hosts listing.

Each resource is thoroughly documented. Please refer to them for full details.

## Installation

From the root of your puppet repository add this module as a submodule:

    $ git submodule add git://github.com/blt/puppet-ssh.git modules/ssh

## Quick Start

To enable sshd:

    class { 'sshd':
        ensure => present,
    }

To build the 'foo' user's id_rsa key:

    ssh::resource::key { 'id_rsa':
        ensure => present,
        user => 'foo',
    }

and set the known_hosts for user 'foo':

    ssh::resource::known_hosts { 'foo':
        hosts => 'git.example.com,github.com',
        user => 'foo',
    }
